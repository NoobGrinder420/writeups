### 🧩 Solution (After Hours of Suffering):

This challenge nearly broke us. We stared at the terminal, ran every reverse engineering tool known to man, brute-forced every permutation of the word “sanity,” and even tried steganography on the challenge description.

Finally — **after extreme mental effort and many sleepless minutes** — we noticed something suspicious...

💡 The flag was... *right there in the description*. Hidden in plain sight. Truly diabolical.

### ✅ Summary:

This was one of the hardest challenges in the CTF. It tested our patience, eyesight, and ability to read English. Some may call it a “sanity check” — we call it a **sanity destroyer**.

Kudos to the challenge author for such an elegantly evil problem.
